Alḥamdulillāh, as the COVID-19 Provincewide Shutdown restrictions have eased in Ottawa, **<span style="text-decoration: underline">starting Wednesday, February 17th, 2021, Musalla As-Ṣaḥāba will open for all daily prayers</span>**.

**However, there will be <span style="text-decoration: underline">only 1 prayer for Salaatul-Jumuʿah at 12:15pm</span> beginning Friday, February 19th, 2021 until further notice.** Please keep in mind that this is with limited capacity on a first come first served basis.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the public health guidelines must be followed by all congregants.  Masks must be worn along with physical distancing and only praying at designated prayer places.  For more information regarding COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions within the City of Ottawa, visit  https://ottawa.ca/en/health-and-public-safety/covid-19-ottawa
